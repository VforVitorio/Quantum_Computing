# Quantum and Natural Computing - Practical Activities

This repository serves as a vault for the practical activity files from the university course **Quantum and Natural Computing**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by sessions (S01, S02, S03, S04, etc.), with each folder containing Python exercises demonstrating various quantum computing concepts using PyQuil.

### Session 02 - Quantum Coin Flipping
Simulations of quantum coin flipping using the Hadamard gate, exploring single and multiple measurements with different approaches.

### Session 03 - Pauli Gates
Demonstrations of the Pauli gates (X, Y, Z) and their effects on quantum states, including gate composition and algebraic relationships.

### Session 04 - Phase Gate
Exploration of the PHASE gate and its effects on quantum states, demonstrating phase shifts on different basis states.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQuil
- Docker (for running the quantum virtual machine)

## Usage

Each Python file contains detailed documentation explaining:
- The quantum circuit being implemented
- Line-by-line code explanations
- Expected output
- Theoretical explanations of the quantum concepts

Simply run any Python file to see the quantum simulation in action:

```bash
python SXX/SXXPXX.py
```

## Documentation

All code files include comprehensive documentation in Spanish, with:
- Program description and purpose
- Quantum gate matrices where relevant
- Detailed comments for each instruction
- Expected output examples
- Theoretical explanations
